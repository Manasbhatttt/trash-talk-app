# 🌱 Community App - Setup Guide

## Overview

The Community App is a Reddit-like social platform integrated with Trash Talk that allows users to:
- Share recycling tips and experiences
- Ask questions about waste management
- Share their recycling statistics
- Upvote/downvote posts and comments
- Filter tips by waste category
- Get community tips directly from the result page

## Architecture

### Frontend Structure
```
frontend/app/community/

```

## Firebase Setup

### Firestore Security Rules

Add these rules to your Firestore:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Community posts
    match /community_posts/{postId} {
      allow read: if true; // Public read
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if request.auth != null && 
                      (request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
                       .hasOnly(['upvotes', 'downvotes', 'commentCount', 'updatedAt']));
      allow delete: if request.auth != null && 
                      resource.data.authorId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Comments
    match /comments/{commentId} {
      allow read: if true; // Public read
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if request.auth != null && 
                      (request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
                       .hasOnly(['upvotes', 'downvotes']));
      allow delete: if request.auth != null && 
                      resource.data.authorId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
