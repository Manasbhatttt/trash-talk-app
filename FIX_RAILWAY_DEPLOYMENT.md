# 🔧 Fix Railway Deployment Error

## Problem
Railway deployment fails with:
```
ImportError: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

**Root Cause**: OpenCV (`opencv-python-headless`) is installed but requires system libraries that aren't available in the Docker image.

## ✅ Solution Applied
1. **Removed OpenCV** from `backend/requirements.txt` - We're using PIL (Pillow) for all image processing
2. **Removed scikit-image** - Not being used in the codebase
3. **Updated requirements.txt** - Now only includes what we actually need

## Files Changed
- ✅ `backend/requirements.txt` - Removed opencv-python-headless and scikit-image

## Next Steps to Deploy the Fix

### Option 1: Quick Push (Recommended)
```powershell
# Add the fixed requirements file
git add backend/requirements.txt

# Commit the fix
git commit -m "Fix deployment: Remove unused OpenCV dependency causing libGL.so.1 error"

# Push to GitHub (Railway will auto-deploy)
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Include in Model Update
If you haven't pushed the model yet, include this fix in the same commit:
```powershell
git add -f backend/model/model.h5
git add backend/requirements.txt
git add frontend/lib/utils.ts frontend/app/upload/page.tsx
git commit -m "Update model (85.75% accuracy) + Fix deployment error + localStorage fix"
git push origin main
```

## What Will Happen
1. ✅ Railway detects the push to GitHub
2. ✅ Railway rebuilds the Docker image with new requirements.txt
3. ✅ OpenCV won't be installed (no more libGL.so.1 error)
4. ✅ App starts successfully with PIL for image processing

## Verification
After Railway finishes deploying:
1. Check **Deploy Logs** - Should show successful startup
2. Check **HTTP Logs** - Should see requests being handled
3. Test the API: `https://trash-talk-app-production-b2cc.up.railway.app/health`

## Why This Works
- We're using **PIL (Pillow)** for all image processing in `predict.py`
- PIL doesn't need system libraries like OpenCV
- Removing unused dependencies makes deployment faster and more reliable
- The Docker image will be smaller and faster to build
