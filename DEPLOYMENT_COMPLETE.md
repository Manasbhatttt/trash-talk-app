### 2. Test the Community App
1. Visit your deployed app
2. Navigate to `/community`
3. Sign in (if not already)
4. Click "Create Post"
5. Create a test post
6. Verify it appears in Firestore Console

### 3. Test Integration
1. Go to `/upload`
2. Upload an image
3. After analysis, click "💡 View more tips from the community →"
4. Should redirect to category-specific tips page

## Firestore Console

View your data:
- **URL**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/trash-talk-5585d/firestore
- **Collections**: `community_posts`, `comments` (will appear when first post is created)

## Troubleshooting

### If posts don't appear:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify user is authenticated
3. Check Firestore rules in console
4. Verify collections exist in Firestore

### If deployment failed:
- Check Vercel logs
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check Firebase project ID matches
